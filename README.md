# A short overview of Python (for scientists)

This repo contains an pre- and post demo Jupyter notebook that was
used to give a short overview of Python to scientists with programming
skills (most of them Matlab). The aim was to show the strength and
philosophy of the language, the ecosystem as well as some of the third
party libraries that are useful for data analysis in a scientific
context.
